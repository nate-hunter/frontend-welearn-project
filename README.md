# WeLearn

## Models:
	- User (student)
	- Tutor
	- Booking/Appointment/Session
	- Location

## MVP:
	- a user can signup/login/logout
	- a user can search/select a tutor by subject and/or location
	- a user can book a booking **CREATE**
	- a user can view a booking **READE**
	- a user can edit a booking **UPDATE**
	- a user can delete a booking **DELETE**

## Stretch Goals:
	- a user can see a map with locations (CARTO)
	- a user can filter the map by subject and/or neighborhood
	- a user can view and utilize a calendar to book a booking (?)
	- a user can complete a payment when booking the appointment. (Stripe)
	- a user can login as a tutor
	- a user can search for meetups, workshops, education events, etc.

### Student (User) [Has-many-tutors-and-locations-through-bookings]
	- name
	- age [integer]
	- grade [integer]
	- goal
	- subject
	- learning_disability [boolean]
	- learning_disability_type

### Tutor [Has-many-users-and-locations-through-bookings] *SEEDED*
	- subjects
	- experience [integer]
	- education
	- age [integer]
	- price-per-hour [integer]
	- specialty
	(- name??)

### Location (WeWork) [Has-many-users-and-tutors-through-bookings] *SEEDED*
	- address
	- burough
	- neighborhood
	- lat
	- lon

### Booking [JOIN]
	- user_id
	- tutor_id
	- location_id
	- date
	- time

#### NOTES:
- A negative of using CARTO is when I deploy this project on Heroku the map may not be visible b/c I need to be logged in. CARTO VL may avoid this though.
